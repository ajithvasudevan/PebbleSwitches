# PebbleSwitches

## Intro
This is a Pebble Watch App, developed on CloudPebble.net using the PebbleJS framework.
This is a companion app for generic home-automation projects that are based on control via http URL calls.

## Operation
PebbleSwitches, once installed and run on the Pebble watch, shows a scrollable list of devices. Selecting any of these items on the Pebble watch (by depressing the middle button) causes a preset http URL to be invoked. This invokation executes the desired home-automation job.
